    "# The Ultimate AI Agent Memory Lab: An End-to-End Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Comprehensive, Hands-On Workshop for Building Smarter Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to a detailed, practical exploration of memory in AI agents. This notebook is designed to be a definitive, end-to-end guide that moves beyond theory and into tangible, working code. We will implement **nine distinct memory strategies**, from the simplest to the most conceptually advanced, using a real large language model for generation, summarization, and embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** By the end of this lab, you will have a deep, practical understanding of:\n",
    "- How each memory strategy works under the hood.\n",
    "- The specific strengths, weaknesses, and tradeoffs of each approach.\n",
    "- How to implement these strategies in Python using modern tools like `openai`, `faiss-cpu`, and `networkx`.\n",
    "- How the choice of memory architecture fundamentally changes an agent's conversational abilities, cost, and complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure of the Lab:**\n",
    "1.  **Part 1: The Core Framework.** We'll set up our environment, configure the LLM client, and build the foundational `AIAgent` and `BaseMemoryStrategy` classes.\n",
    "2.  **Part 2: The Memory Implementations.** We will systematically implement and demonstrate all nine memory strategies. Each strategy will have its own dedicated section with:\n",
    "    *   **Detailed Theory:** Explaining the *what*, *why*, and *how*.\n",
    "    *   **Code Implementation:** A complete, commented Python class for the strategy.\n",
    "    *   **Live Demonstration:** A practical chat session designed to showcase the strategy's unique behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is intentionally lengthy and detailed to serve as a comprehensive reference. Let's begin by setting up our core components."

    "**Theory:** This is a modification to the *model architecture itself* and cannot be fully implemented at the agent level. However, we can *simulate its behavior*. The core idea is that the model has access to a special, compressed memory space (like \"sticky notes\") in addition to its normal context window. It learns to write key information to these memory slots and read from them when needed.\n",

After each turn, it will use the LLM to decide if any information is important enough to be a \"key memory.\" If so, it will create a concise summary of that fact and store it in a special list of `memory_tokens`. The final context will be a combination of a sliding window of recent chat and these important `memory_tokens`."

    "**Theory:** This advanced concept borrows from how a computer's Operating System manages memory. It treats the LLM's context window as **RAM** (fast, small, expensive) and an external store as a **hard disk** (slow, large, cheap). Information is moved between them.\n",
    "- **Paging Out:** When RAM (the active context) is full, a policy (like Least Recently Used - LRU) moves the oldest information to the hard disk (a passive store).\n",
    "- **Paging In (Page Fault):** When a query needs information that isn't in RAM, a \"page fault\" occurs. The system then retrieves (pages in) the required information from the hard disk back into RAM, possibly swapping something else out.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our Simulation:** We'll create an `active_memory` (list) and a `passive_memory` (dict for fast lookups). When `active_memory` is full, we'll move the LRU item to `passive_memory`. Our `get_context` will use retrieval to see if the query requires any data from `passive_memory`, simulating a page-in."

    "## Lab Conclusion and Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on completing this deep dive into AI agent memory! We have successfully implemented and tested nine distinct strategies, observing firsthand how each one impacts an agent's performance, cost, and capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways from this Lab:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **There is No Silver Bullet:** The choice of memory is fundamentally a design decision based on your agent's purpose. A simple Q&A bot might only need a `SlidingWindow`, while a long-term personal assistant would thrive on a `Hierarchical` or `Retrieval` system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **The Spectrum of Complexity:** We've seen a clear progression from simple, linear stores (`Sequential`) to complex, structured data (`GraphMemory`) and dynamic systems (`OSMemory`). Increasing complexity offers more power but requires more sophisticated engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **LLMs as Tools:** Several advanced strategies (`Summarization`, `GraphMemory`, `MemoryAugmented`) don't just use the LLM for chat; they use it as an intelligent tool for processing, structuring, and compressing memory itself. This is a powerful paradigm in modern agent design.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Hybrid Systems are the Future:** The most robust production agents often use hybrid approaches. Our `HierarchicalMemory` is a prime example, combining the speed of a sliding window with the precision of retrieval. You can mix and match these strategies to create a custom memory architecture tailored to your exact needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a starting point. You can continue to explore by:\n",
    "- **Tuning Parameters:** Adjust `window_size`, `k` for retrieval, and summarization thresholds to see how they affect performance.\n",
    "- **Implementing More Advanced Logic:** Improve the promotion logic in `HierarchicalMemory` or the page-fault detection in `OSMemory` using embeddings.\n",
    "- **Creating New Hybrids:** Combine `GraphMemory` with `RetrievalMemory` to search both structured and unstructured data simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
